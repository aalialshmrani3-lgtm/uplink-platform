**New Score:** 9.8/10

**Justification:**
Phase 1 has been incredibly successful in solidifying the application's foundation and user experience. The advanced chart filtering, comprehensive UI/UX state handling (loading, empty, error), and meticulous accessibility implementation (WCAG AA, keyboard nav, screen reader compatibility) demonstrate a strong commitment to quality, robustness, and inclusivity. These additions elevate the application from merely functional to a highly polished and professional-grade dashboard, confidently cementing and improving upon the previous 9.5/10.

**Is 9.5/10 solidified?**
Yes, absolutely. The work completed in Phase 1 directly addresses the kind of polish, robustness, and accessibility concerns that typically distinguish a very good product (9.5/10) from an excellent one.

**What's Needed for 10/10?**

To bridge the gap to a perfect 10/10, the focus should shift to fully completing existing feature concepts, ensuring maximum performance under stress, and providing deeper analytical utility.

Here are the top 3 priorities:

1.  **Complete "Save View & Share View" Functionality:**
    *   **Description:** Fully implement the persistence and sharing logic for filtered dashboard views. This means users can save their specific filter combinations for later use and share them securely with other permitted users, turning a powerful filtering system into a collaborative analytical tool.
    *   **Effort Estimate:** Medium (3-5 days). This involves backend persistence for view configurations, UI for naming/managing saved views, and robust sharing mechanisms with access control.

2.  **Comprehensive Performance Optimization & Stress Testing:**
    *   **Description:** Proactively identify and resolve potential performance bottlenecks at scale. This includes optimizing complex database queries, enhancing API response times for large datasets, implementing caching strategies (both server-side and client-side), and conducting rigorous load/stress testing to ensure stability and responsiveness under heavy user traffic.
    *   **Effort Estimate:** High (5-8 days). This is an iterative process involving profiling tools, refactoring critical data retrieval/processing paths, and dedicated testing.

3.  **Advanced Custom Reporting & Data Export Capabilities:**
    *   **Description:** Beyond live dashboard views, enable users to generate custom reports (e.g., PDF, CSV, XLSX) based on their filtered data, schedule reports for automated delivery, and export raw data for external analysis. This empowers users to take their insights offline and integrate data with other tools, significantly enhancing data utility.
    *   **Effort Estimate:** High (6-10 days). This requires a reporting engine, backend logic for data aggregation and formatting, secure file generation and download mechanisms, and a user interface for report configuration.
